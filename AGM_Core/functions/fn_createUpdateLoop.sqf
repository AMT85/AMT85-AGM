 * Compiles a loop that executes pieces of code when the corresponding conditions change their return value. The loop will exit when the exit condition is true. Note: Don't use it. It's still WIP.
 * 
 * Argument:
 * 0: The scripts name (String)
 * 1: The code that is executed before the loop begins. (Code or String)
 * 2: The loop will sleep for this long. In seconds. (Number)
 * 3: Each time any of these functions change their return value, the function with the same index is called. (Array of Codes or Strings)
 * 4: Functions that are called, when the condition with the same index changes its value. (Array of Codes or Strings)
 * 5: Exit condition. If this returns true, the loop will exit and the exit code is called. (Code or String)
 * 6: The code that is executed after the loop ends. (Code or String)
 * 
 * Return value:
 * Nothing
